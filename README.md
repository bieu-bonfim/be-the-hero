# Be The Hero!

"Be The Hero" application development using JavaScript.
I developed this app while participating in Omnistack Week (11 Edition) by Rocketseat.

The API was developed using Node.js.
It provides all information necessary to be consumed on FrontEnd.


Website developed using ReactJS.
NGOs (Non Governmental Organizations) can sing up and create cases, those cases have a title, description and value.


Mobile APP developed using React Native.
All users can download the app and search for existing cases, after that they can contact the ONGs and donate any amount of money to help the cases.
